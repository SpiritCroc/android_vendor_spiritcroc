# SpiritCroc's vendor

This repository contains some ROM additions that I like to have in my personal builds,
but might not be suitable for including by default in official builds.

In order to use this, clone it into vendor/extra.
Custom ROMs like AICP or LineageOS will automatically call it if they find it in that location.

# Features

- Custom bootanimation
    - If you want to go back to the default bootanimation, you can delete `/product/media/bootanimation.zip` on your device
- Enable lockscreen rotation for all devices by default
